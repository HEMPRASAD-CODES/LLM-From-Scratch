## Building Your Own GPT: README

This repository contains a step-by-step Jupyter notebook for building a simple GPT-style language model from scratch, inspired by the [Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) series by Andrej Karpathy. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and generation, using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset as an example[1].

### **Features**

- **Data Preparation:** Downloads and processes the Tiny Shakespeare dataset for character-level language modeling.
- **Tokenization:** Maps unique characters to integer indices and vice versa.
- **Model Architecture:** Implements a simple transformer-based language model, including:
  - Token and positional embeddings
  - Multi-head self-attention with masking (decoder-style)
  - Feed-forward layers and layer normalization
- **Training Loop:** Trains the model using PyTorch with AdamW optimizer.
- **Text Generation:** Generates text samples from a trained model.
- **Educational Commentary:** Inline explanations and toy examples for key concepts like self-attention, masking, and layer normalization.

### **Quick Start**

#### **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment

#### **Setup**

1. **Clone this repository and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd 
   pip install torch jupyter
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `building-own-llm-1.ipynb` in your browser.

3. **Run the notebook cells sequentially:**
   - The notebook will automatically download the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
   - All code is self-contained and ready to execute in order[1].

### **Notebook Structure**

| Section                   | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Download & Inspection| Downloads and inspects the dataset.                                         |
| Tokenization              | Maps characters to integers and vice versa.                                 |
| Data Splitting            | Splits data into training and validation sets.                              |
| Batch Generation          | Prepares mini-batches for training.                                         |
| Model Definition          | Implements a transformer-based language model in PyTorch.                   |
| Training Loop             | Trains the model and prints loss metrics.                                   |
| Text Generation           | Samples text from the trained model.                                        |
| Self-Attention Explained  | Contains toy examples and explanations for self-attention and masking.       |
| Full Reference Code       | Provides a complete code listing for the model and training loop.           |

### **Usage Example**

After training, you can generate Shakespeare-like text:

```python
context = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long, device=device)
print(decode(model.generate(context, max_new_tokens=2000)[0].tolist()))
```

### **Customization**

- **Dataset:** Replace the Tiny Shakespeare dataset with your own text for custom language modeling.
- **Hyperparameters:** Adjust embedding size, number of heads, layers, and training steps for experimentation.
- **Model Extensions:** The notebook serves as a foundation for more advanced architectures (e.g., GPT-2/3)[2].
